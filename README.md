## Guitar Chord Flash Cards
Quizlet doesn't allow for images in flashcards unless you are a paid user so I made a barebones version

## Usage
### Flip
1. click the card
2. Up arrow key
3. Down arrow key

### Next Card
1. Right arrow key
2. Left arrow key

### Autoflip
if there is a number entered in the autoflip field the chords will automatically change every x seconds and flip every x / 2.
