## Guitar Chord Flash Cards
Quizlet doesn't allow for images in flashcards unless you are a paid user so I made a barebones version.
I'm most likely not going to be making any updates to this unless something completely breaks. Feel free to fork and create any modifications you want.

## Usage - Mobile
1. tap to flip
2. double tap to switch to next

## Usage - Desktop
### Flip
1. click the card
2. Up arrow key
3. Down arrow key

### Next Card
1. Right arrow key
2. Left arrow key
3. Double tap

### Autoflip
if there is a number entered in the autoflip field the chords will automatically change every x seconds and flip every x / 2.

# Changing Cards
If you ever want to use this as a baseline for another set of flash cards you can replace the strings in the flip.js chords array to whatever you want. It will search in the chords/ folder for the name.png.
